## Limitations

Since this is a front-end only application, there is no server-side logic to handle user authentication or data storage. Data is stored in the browser's local storage, which means that data will be lost if the user clears their browser data. Additionally, since there is no authentication, anyone with access to the app can view and modify tasks. If you require authentication or server-side data storage, you will need to implement a backend system.
